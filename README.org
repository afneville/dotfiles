#+TITLE: Personal Configuration Files

A version control repository for some of my system configuration files. The word /dotfile/ is a colloquialism referring to the leading =.= character used to hide a file in most Unix-like systems.

Initially, a single repository was sufficient for managing my configuration files, but gradually different parts have been separated into their own repositories and included as submodules. The original, archived repository - which I no longer use - is [[https://github.com/alexanderneville/config_archive][here]]. Other, currently in-use repositories are:

- [[https://github.com/alexanderneville/nvim-config][My Neovim Configuration]]
- [[https://github.com/alexanderneville/emacs-config][My Emacs Configuration]]
- [[https://github.com/alexanderneville/b16-themes][My Colour Themes]]

* Deployment with Stow

For quick deployment on new machines, the files in this repository are organised in the fashion of *GNU Stow*, a symlink farm manager. Less attractive ways to manage deployment would involve either a messy deployment script or a lot of manual copying/symlinking. Stow, on the other hand, can automatically make and remove symlinks for both files and directories. 

I have organised this project so that each subdirectory acts as a reference point to =~/=. Files positioned at a given point relative to each of these subdirectories will be placed in the same position relative to =~/= when /stowed/. An example of =stow -t ~/ shell= invocation:

#+begin_src text
./shell/ -> ~/
|--.bashrc -> ~/.bashrc
|--.zshnenv -> ~/.zshenv
`--.config/ -> ~/.config/
    `--zsh/ -> ~/.config/zsh/
        |--rc.sh -> ~/.config/zsh/rc.sh
        `--...
#+end_src

* Installation

To install: clone the repository; initialise the submodules and stow the relevant configuration /modules/ in the home directory.

#+begin_src text
  git clone https://github.com/alexanderneville/dotfiles.git
  git submodule update --init --remote --recursive
  stow -t ~/ apps shell wm bin X11 submodules
#+end_src
